<strong>Why Gmail ?</strong>
   	<br><br>(1) More Secure: Using Secure SSL connection to deliver mail to Google Mail Server, which send to other MAIL Server mostly by Secure TLS Connection, therefore email is very hard to be intercepted on internet.
    <br><br>(2) Deliver mail to right place: Always send to recipient Inbox instead of Spam box or Junk box.
    <br><br>(3) Send more emails and cost less: Comparing other email marketing sites. free trial Gmail send max 500 email/day, business Gmail account pays $5 only to send 2000 emails/day, other site pay $29 send 2500 emails/month. 
     
    <br><br> In our Email Marketing page, the email sender is using Agent Gmail to connect Google Mail Server to send bulk emails, therefore registered Agents get above benefits
