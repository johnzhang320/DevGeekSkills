<p>Here we explain the different types of mortgage loans &amp; options We can provide. They go along with how they can assist home owners if researched and put together properly. The right loan option can help a home owner save a lot of money over the life of their loan and we help you decide which option is right for you here.</p>
 
<h2><strong>Conventional Loans:</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Conventional loans are mortgage loans offered by non-government sponsored lenders. These loan types include:</p>
<p>* Fixed Rate Loans</p>
<p>* Adjustable Rate Loans (ARMs)</p>
<p>* Combination (Hybrid) Loans</p>
<p>* Balloon Mortgages and Pledge Asset Loans</p>
<p>* Jumbo / Construction Loans</p>
<p>* Reverse Mortgage</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
 
<h2><strong>Jumbo Loans:</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Jumbo Loans exceed the maximum loan amounts established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conventional loan limits.</p>
<p>Rates on jumbo loans are typically higher than conforming loans.</p>
<p>Jumbo Loans are typically used to buy more expensive homes and high-end custom construction homes.</p>
<h2><strong>Conforming Loans:</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Conforming loans are conventional loans that meet bank-funding criteria set by Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC). Both of these stock-holding companies buy mortgage loans from lending institutions and secure them for resale to the investment community. Every year, form October to October, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac establish limits on what constitutes a conforming loan in a mean home price.</p>
<p>Buying back mortgage loans allow these agencies to provide a continuous flow of affordable funding to banks that reinvest their money back into more mortgage loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only buy loans that are conforming, to repackage into the secondary market &#8211; effectively decreasing the demand for non-conforming loans.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Fixed Rate Mortgage:</strong></h2>
<p>With a fixed rate mortgage, the interest rate does not change for the term of the loan, so the monthly payment is always the same. Typically, the shorter the loan period, the more attractive the interest rate will be.</p>
<p>Payments on fixed-rate fully amortizing loans are calculated so that the loan is paid in full at the end of the term. In the early amortization period of the mortgage, a large percentage of the monthly payment pays the interest on the loan. As the mortgage is paid down, more of the monthly payment is applied toward the principal.</p>
<p>A 30 year fixed rate mortgage is the most popular type of loan when borrowers are able to lock into a low rate.</p>
<p><em> Benefits:</em></p>
<p>* Lower monthly payments than a 15 year fixed rate mortgage</p>
<p>* Interest rate does not go up if interest rates go up</p>
<p>* Payment does not go up, it stays the same for 30 years</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> Drawbacks:</em></p>
<p>* Higher interest rate than a 15 year fixed rate mortgage</p>
<p>* Interest rate stays the same even if interest rates go down</p>
<p>A 15 year fixed rate mortgage allows you to pay off your loan quicker and lock into an attractive lower interest rate.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> Benefits:</em></p>
<p>* Lower interest rate</p>
<p>* Build equity faster</p>
<p>* If interest rates go up, yours is fixed</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> Drawbacks:</em></p>
<p>* Higher monthly payment stays the same if interest rates go down</p>
<p>* Interest rate stays the same even if interest rates go down</p>
<p><strong><em>Combined/Hybrid ARMs:  A combination of fixed rate and adjustable rate loans:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fixed-Period ARMs</strong></p>
<p>Borrows often lock into 3 to 10 years of fixed rate payments before the initial interest rate change. At the end of the fixed period, the interest rate adjusts annually. Fixed-period ARMs are typically tied to the one-year Treasury securities index: 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1.</p>
<p>ARMs with an initial fixed period beside of lifetime and adjustment caps usually have also first adjustment cap. It limits the interest rate you will pay the first time your rate is adjusted. First adjustment caps vary with type of loan program.</p>
<p>The advantage of these loans is that the interest rate is lower than for a 30-year fixed (the lender is not locked in for as long so their risk is lower and they can charge less) but you still get the advantage of a fixed rate for a period of time.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Balloon Loan</strong></p>
<p>Balloon Loans offer a fixed rate for a specified time period, typically 5 or 7 years, and then adjust to the current market rate. After the adjustment the mortgage stays at the new fixed rate for the remainder of the loan period.</p>
<h2>Graduated Payment ARMs</h2>
<p>Graduated payment mortgages initially offer lower payments at the start of the loan that gradually increase at preset times. Lower initial payments allow borrowers to qualify for a larger loan amount. Loan amounts negatively amortize during the early years of the loan then pay off the principal at an accelerated rate through the later years.</p>
<p>GPM payment plans will vary by rate of payment increases and number of years over which payments will increase. The greater the rate of increase, or the longer the period of increase &#8212; the lower the initial mortgage payments.</p>
<h2><strong>Convertible ARMs</strong></h2>
<p>If an adjustable rate mortgage is convertible, the borrower may convert to a fixed rate mortgage, when interest rates begin to rise, without refinancing. The new rate is established at the current market rate for fixed-rate mortgages. The terms of convertibility vary among lenders. Typically it involves a nominal fee and minimal paperwork. The downside is that the conversion interest rate is often a little higher than the market rate at the time of conversion.</p>
<p>A fixed rate loan with a rate reduction option allows borrowers, under predetermined conditions, to adjust to the current market rate for a nominal fee. The discount points or interest rates are often slightly higher for convertible loans.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Buydown Mortgage</strong></h2>
<p>A temporary buydown initially offers a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments. In order to reduce monthly payments during the first years, borrowers make an initial lump sum payment or agree to a higher interest rate. Over the years, the interest rate gradually increases until it peaks at a fixed rate. Borrowers who chose this loan often expect a significant increase in their income.</p>
<h2><strong>Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM):</strong></h2>
<p>An ARM is a mortgage with an interest rate that may vary over the term of the loan &#8212; usually in response to changes in the prime rate or Treasury Bill rate. The purpose of the interest rate adjustment is primarily to bring the interest rate on the mortgage in line with market rates.</p>
<p>Mortgage holders are protected by a ceiling, or maximum interest rate, which can be reset annually. ARMs typically begin with more attractive rates than fixed rate mortgages &#8212; compensating the borrower for the risk of future interest rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>Choosing an ARM is a good idea when:</p>
<p>* Interest rates are going down</p>
<p>* You intend to keep your home less than 5 years</p>
<p>ARMs have the following distinguishing features:</p>
<p>* Index</p>
<p>* Margin</p>
<p>* Adjustment Frequency</p>
<p>* Initial Interest Rate</p>
<p>* Interest Rate Caps</p>
<p>* Convertibility</p>
