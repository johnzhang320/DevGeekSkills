Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the 
client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds 
an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.

This pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by client and delegates calls 
to methods of existing system classes.

We are going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing the Shape interface. A facade class 
ShapeMaker is defined as a next step.
