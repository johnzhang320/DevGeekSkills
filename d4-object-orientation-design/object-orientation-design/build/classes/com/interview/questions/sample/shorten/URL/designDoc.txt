
Problem 2: Design a URL shortener service like goo.gl (solution)
You need to design a URL shortener service like bit.ly or goo.gl. You can insert full URL and get a short one. 
Your short URL should also record the stats about how many time it was accessed. Your system should also be 
able to handle concurrent user and millions of URL shortening per day. Think about auditing and bookkeeping 
as well. Btw, If you struggle to start with this questions then you can also see the Cracking the Coding Interview 
book, which contains a whole chapter on Object Oriented design and how to approach such problems.
 
Shorten URL procedure

(1) once a request comes in, we create thread to process this request, 
(2) If request to shorten URL, we create database, row is sequence from 10000, check if URL in database or not, if not find unique sequence ID from
    database, here create new sequence ID and save URL associated with the ID, using concurrent hash map to avoid the synchronized problem
(3) encode ID to heximal data as shorten URL to return to user, last two character as domain name
(4) if user use shorten URL access. decode shortne url to Integer ID and fetch URL for it.
