
Design a Traffic Controller System for a Junction?
You need to design a software to control traffic lights at a junction where traffic are coming from four sides. 
It should follow basic traffic rules, allow a pedestrian to cross the road, and traffic to pass in reasonable time.
How do you optimize the waiting time with respect to high traffic from one direction e.g. during morning and evening rush hours?

Implementation by John Zhang

(1) We desgin 4 threads to simulate the four sides comming traffic and pedestrain and add them into queues
(2) We design one timer thread to turn on/off direction, on means horizantal direction and off means vertical 
(3) We design 4 threads to simulate passing traffic, if horizantal, two threads to simulate east to west or west to east
    another two threads to simulate north to south or south to north
(4) Design traffic interface , implemented by vechicle and pedestrain classes , contain direction, id, comingFrequence, passingSpeed
(5) Design enum contain EAST, WEST,NORTH and SOUTH as TrafficSide, and Direction contain direction boolean variable
