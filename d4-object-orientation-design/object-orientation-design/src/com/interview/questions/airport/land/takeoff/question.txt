 
I'm simulating an airport with one runway. There are 2 queues for planes 
waiting to land and waiting to take off. There can only be one plane on 
the runway at a time, and all planes in the air have to land before any
planes take off. 
LinkedBlockingQueue is core queue we must totally understand how to use it
The major implementation difference between the two data structures 
(synchronization-wise) is that because ArrayBlockingQueue keeps the elements 
in an array it needs only one lock to keep everything synchronized. On the 
other hand, LinkedBlockingQueue uses two locks, one for insertion and one 
for extraction. That happens because while ArrayBlockingQueue contains just 
an array, LinkedBlockingQueue contains a series of connected nodes, so it doesn’t need to keep track of insertion and extraction at the same time.
