Highlight:
(1) Spring Taglib and Standard are not enough for logic process, object exist detect and list / Map collection process
    Integrate Struts 1.1 Taglib into JSP 
(2) Spring ModelAndView and Command object are not in Session and Request, Change Locale and Child Window refresh Parent Window
    we should use session or request object to keep context data like locale change data
(3) org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.LocaleChangeInterceptor only listens link parameter <a href="?lang=en"></a>
    IF application support 10+ languages, we should not use 10+ links.  We code the 
    localeResolver.setLocale(request, response, (Locale) localeEditor.getValue())
    in MultiActionController to dynamically accept $.ajax post request, it allows return null instead of ModelAndView real object
    then we use javascript reload page after user select language drop down list.
    In this controller we also save user current selected language into session and ensure selected language still shown in list
    after javascript reload page.
    
(4) Spring Annotation Controller is bound to form such as 
    @RequestMapping(value="/localChange", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    When use $.ajax call this kind of controller , throw Exception
    It must return object, forward or redirect explicit page but language change is in header page in tile
    but body could be any page, we can not grap it
    More importance is we need only change locale in session, do not forward or rediect page while change language
